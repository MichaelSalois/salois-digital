        <h1>Stop Losing <span class="gradient-text">High-Value Emergency Jobs</span> to Missed Calls</h1>

        <p>
          When a pipe bursts at 10 PM or a water heater fails on Sunday morning, homeowners don’t browse — they call the first plumber they see on Google. If no one answers, they immediately call the next company. That $800 repair or $4,500 replacement job is gone in seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          We build a complete revenue-capture system for plumbing contractors: high-intent Google Ads for emergency searches, local SEO that keeps you in the map pack, and a 24/7 AI Voice Agent that answers every call, qualifies the job, and captures the details — even when your office is closed.
